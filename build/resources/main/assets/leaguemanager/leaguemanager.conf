# Set your Gym Leader(s) and/or E4 League member names here, in the regions they need to be in.
# I'll provide an example below using the Kanto Pokemon League
# LeagueManager will look for these region names in AreaManager's configuration, confirm they exist, and will then create a file for each one in the respective location
# i.e. "/config/leaguemanager/gyms/<regionName>/<fileName.conf>" and "/config/leaguemanager/leagues/<regionName>/<fileName.conf>"
